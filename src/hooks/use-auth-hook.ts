// This file can be removed if AuthContext is simple enough or directly used.
// For now, we'll define AuthContext in auth-provider.tsx and use React.useContext directly.
// If logic grows, this hook can be a dedicated file.
// For now, this file will be empty to indicate it's merged into auth-provider.tsx.
