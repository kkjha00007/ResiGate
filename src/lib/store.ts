// This file is no longer needed as data persistence is handled by Azure Cosmos DB via API routes.
// You can safely delete this file.
// All functions like getUsers, setUsers, addVisitorEntry, etc. are now replaced by API calls.
// The AuthProvider has been updated to use these API calls.
// Mock data is also no longer used for initialization in the same way.
